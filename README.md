# XML_VALIDATION

This repository provides a guide and resources for XML validation. XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a widely used language for structuring and storing data in a human-readable format. Validating XML documents ensures that they conform to a specific XML schema or structure, helping to maintain data integrity and interoperability.

This README file will cover the basics of XML validation, including why validation is important, how to validate XML documents, and the tools you can use for XML validation.
